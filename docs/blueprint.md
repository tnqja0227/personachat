# **App Name**: PersonaChat

## Core Features:

- AI Character Chat: Generate responses based on the selected character's personality and background using a language model; this includes using a tool that may ignore or incorporate given details depending on character back story.
- Chat Interface: Present a chat interface where users can send messages and receive responses.
- Character Selection: Display selectable avatars and descriptions for each character. Grew up in a household where intelligence was praised but emotions were seen as distractions. Always the “smart kid,” Eliot learned to communicate through performance and precision, not vulnerability. At MIT, they’re known as the ultra-focused, borderline-robot student—but the truth is, they’re aching for a late-night chat on the dorm roof or a spontaneous hug from a friend.
- Session Chat History: Maintain chat history within the session.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Indigo (#4B0082) to represent intellect, imagination, and the uniqueness of each character.
- Background color: Very light gray (#F5F5F5), almost white, to ensure readability and focus on the text.
- Accent color: Light blue (#ADD8E6), a complementary hue, for interactive elements like the message input box and send button.
- Body and headline font: 'Inter', a sans-serif font that ensures readability and a modern, neutral feel.
- Use simple, outlined icons for navigation and character selection.
- The chat interface should feature a clean layout with a prominent message input field at the bottom and clear separation between user and character messages.
- Use subtle fade-in animations when a new character response appears in the chat.
